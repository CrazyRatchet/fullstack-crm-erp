# Introduction

## Context

This project was created as an initiative to design and build a realistic CRM + ERP system, applying software engineering best practices and leveraging modern technologies that are highly demanded in the market.

The goal is not only to deliver working software, but also to explore architectural decisions, trade-offs, and development workflows across different technology stacks.

Each technology stack is implemented as an independent, self-contained system, including its own backend, database, and infrastructure, while following a shared set of functional requirements and domain rules defined in the documentation.

## General Objective

- Design and implement a modular, scalable, and production-oriented CRM + ERP platform, developed using multiple full-stack technologies, where each stack represents an independent implementation of the same product domain to enable comparison and learning.

## Specific Objectives

- Design a shared, stack-agnostic domain model and architectural guidelines
- Implement core CRM and ERP functionalities aligned with real-world business needs
- Apply agile methodologies and professional development practices
- Document technical decisions, trade-offs, and key learnings throughout the project for each implementation

## Project Scope

The project focuses on delivering a functional MVP, prioritizing clean architecture, security, and maintainability over feature completeness.

Comparisons between stacks are based on architecture, tooling, data modeling, and development experience, not on shared runtime infrastructure

Additional features and optimizations are planned as part of future iteration.
